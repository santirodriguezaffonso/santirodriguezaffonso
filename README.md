## Profile_
An iOS developer in process and amateur rugby player, what a mix! 🤪. 
I consider myself a person who is always looking for new knowledge. 
Asking to people about issues and solutions. Strongly principled and always trying to be more intellectually honest than yesterday. 
Finally, I think I’m a passionate about tech.

## AboutMe_

Hi, I’m @santirodriguezaffonso I used to be an advanced law student but I decided to make a change in my career. 
Since I was a kid I’ve been in touch with computers –my first one was a Win. 95– but for some reason I ended up studying law –*"You will be what you must to be or you will be a lawyer"*–. 
After five years of studying, trough my friends and my own research I discovered what programming really was. So I decided to go deeper into the IT world.

I started to looking information about different technologies, and I decided on a position that intrigued me from the beginning “iOS Developer” –I’m a great Apple fan, his software and hardware–.

Finally in 2022, with a great desire to learn, I began to take my first steps to reach my goal, to become an iOS developer. 
Currently I’m doing an intensive training “iOS & Swift Development Bootcamp” in Udemy –programming principles, Swift, UIKit/SwiftUI, architect patterns MVC/MVVM, UI principles, etc–. 
Giving place to a professional transformation and looking for a road in the IT world. 

At the end of the day it’s about going back to where I was native.
