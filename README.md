Strongly principled and always trying to be more intellectually honest than yesterday. I’m passionate about tech.

## AboutMe_

👋🏻 I’m @santirodriguezaffonso I used to be an advanced law student but I decided to make a change in my career. Since I was a kid I’ve been in touch with computers –my first one was a Win. 95– but for some reason, I ended up studying law –"You will be what you must to be or you will be a lawyer"–. 
After five years of studying, through my friends and my own research, I discovered what programming really was. So I decided to go deeper into the programming world.

I started looking for information about different technologies, and I decided on a position that intrigued me from the beginning “iOS Developer” –'cause I’m a great Apple fan, his software and hardware is magnificent–.

Finally in 2022, with a great desire to learn, I began to take my first steps to reach my goal, to become an iOS developer 📚💻      
I already achieved my ["Scrum Fundamentals Certified" from ScrumStudy](https://www.scrumstudy.com/certification/verify?type=SFC&number=920503) and the certificate of completion in [“iOS & Swift App Development Bootcamp” - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/). Currently, I’m doing a certification in ["Fundamentals of Programming" - UTN.BA](https://sceu.frba.utn.edu.ar/e-learning/detalle/curso/338/fundamentos-de-la-programacion?id=999188122).

On the other hand, I've been working as ***Junior Mobile Developer*** at [IT Crowd Arg](https://www.itcrowdarg.com) since July 2022 🙌🏻

**_This is about professional transformation and finding my road in the IT world ✨_**
