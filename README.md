## AboutMe_

👋🏻 I’m @santirodriguezaffonso I used to be an advanced law student but I decided to make a change in my career. Since I was a kid I’ve been in touch with computers –my first one was a Win. 95– but for some reason, I ended up studying law –"You will be what you must to be or you will be a lawyer"–. 
After five years of studying, through my friends and my own research, I discovered what programming really was. So I decided to go deeper into the programming world.

I started looking for information about different technologies, and I decided on a position that intrigued me from the beginning “iOS Developer” –'cause I’m a great Apple fan, his software and hardware is magnificent–.

Finally in 2022, with a great desire to learn, I began to take my first steps to reach my goal, to become an iOS developer 📚💻      
Currently, I’m doing an intensive training in [“iOS & Swift App Development Bootcamp” - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/), a certification in ["Fundamentals of Programming" - UTN.BA](https://sceu.frba.utn.edu.ar/e-learning/detalle/curso/338/fundamentos-de-la-programacion?id=999188122) and I already have my ["Scrum Fundamentals Certified" from ScrumStudy](https://www.scrumstudy.com/certification/verify?type=SFC&number=920503).
